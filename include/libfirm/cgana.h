 * @brief
 *  Interprocedural analysis to estimate the calling relation.
 *
 *  This analysis computes all entities representing methods that
 *  can be called at a Call node.  Further it computes a set of
 *  methods that are 'free', i.e., their address is handled by
 *  the program directly, or they are visible external.

/** Analyses a rough estimation of the possible call graph.
 *
 *  Determines for each Call node the set of possibly called methods.
 *  Stores the result in the field 'callees' of the Call node.  If the
 *  address can not be analysed, e.g. because it is loaded from a
 *  variable, the array contains the unknown_entity. (See
 *  set_Call_callee()). cgana() returns the set of 'free' methods, i.e.,
 *  the methods that can be called from external or via function
 *  pointers.  This data structure must be freed with 'xfree()' by the
 *  caller of cgana().
 *
 *  cgana() sets the callee_info_state of each graph and the program to
 *  consistent.
 *
 *  The algorithm implements roughly Static Class Hierarchy Analysis
 *  as described in "Optimization of Object-Oriented Programs Using
 *  Static Class Hierarchy Analysis" by Jeffrey Dean and David Grove
 *  and Craig Chambers.
 *
 *  Performs some optimizations possible by the analysed information:
 *  - Replace (Sel-method(Alloc)) by Address.
 *  - Replaces Sel-method by Address if the method is never overwritten.
