libFirm -- A graph based SSA intermediate representation
========================================================

Introduction
------------

The Firm library implements the Firm intermediate representation (ir).
You can find an old description of Firm in [TLB:99].

libFirm contains algorithms for construction of the SSA form directly from the
attributed syntax tree. A set of analyses and optimization phases is provided.
This version includes a complete backend for the IA32 and SPARC architecture,
as well as unfinished backends for MIPS, ARM, and AMD64.

Building and Installation
-------------------------

Prerequisites for the build:

* Python (>=3.5 are supported)
* Perl
* an ANSI C99 compiler (gcc, clang, icc are known to work)
* Git

### Building with make

Just type 'make' in the source directory. The results are put into a
directory called "build". You can override the existing preprocessor, compiler
and linker flags by creating a 'config.mak' file.

### Building with cmake

libFirm has an additional cmake build system. CMake is a more complex build
system than the make based one and most libFirm developers do not use it.
However it can adapt the compiler and linker flags to build shared libraries
for a wider range of systems, provides an installation target and is often more
familiar for people preparing packages for distribution.
